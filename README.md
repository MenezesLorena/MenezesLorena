Hi, I'm @Menezeslorena,
I'm learning languages and technology,
my hobbies are cooking, drawing, watching, reading, walking, listening to music and bodybuilding, which has become a way of life,
I love spending quality time with those I love, for example having ice cream and going out for dinner.
i love watching kdramas, one that i loved the most was Mr queen,
my favorite dessert is pudding and my favorite food is macaroni and potato mayonnaise.
i love cats and dogs,
And I want to be a great professional no matter what I choose.
i love kung fu panada because i identify with po and his journey to discover who he is. and the movie makes you think about your whole life with many profound phrases that touch the soul.
my song of the moment is Justin bieber's company.
come with me on this journey!
